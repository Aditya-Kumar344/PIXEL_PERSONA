## Project Overview
This project is a part of Winter Projects, 2024 by Institute Consulting group, IIT Kanpur. It builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of people into two categories: Female or Male. The model is built from scratch and we've not used any pre-trained models to achieve the result.

## Features
- Gender detection of images in test dataset and measurement of accuracy of the model!
- Gender detection using custom images that can be uploaded by the user!!
- Live Gender detection using image captured by a user from their own webcam!!!

## Dataset
The kaggle dataset used for training and testing this model can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserhessein/gender-dataset).
