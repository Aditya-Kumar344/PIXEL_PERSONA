<span style="font-size: 36px;">GENDER DETECTION MODEL USING CNN</span>
<span style="font-size: 24px;">Introduction to dataset</span>
<span style="font-size: 12px;">I have used this dataset from kaggle, which has 203k files, but I've used 12,000 train examples and 12,000 test examples equally divided between male and female labels so that the model does not take forever to run.</span>
